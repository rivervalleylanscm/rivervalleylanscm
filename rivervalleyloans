Consider whether you feel financially comfortable making the loan’s monthly payment, regardless of how your investment performs.

Make sure to factor in any existing debt you’re repaying now and other goals you’re saving toward (e.g., saving up for a home). If after you’ve crunched the numbers and looked carefully at your budget, you still feel confident about your ability to repay the loan, this might be an option for you.

If you can easily afford the monthly payments, however, you might consider squirreling away the money in a savings account until you can afford to pay for the investment yourself out of pocket- which eliminates any risk associated with taking out a personal loan, as well as interest fees.

Yet another alternative is fractional investing, through which you could use the money you would otherwise have put toward monthly personal loan payments, to buy into investments gradually. This option also allows you to avoid the interest and risks associated with a personal loan.
