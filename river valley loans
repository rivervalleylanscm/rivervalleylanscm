If you need the investment to deliver on its suggested returns to afford your personal loan, this route is a bad idea. No investment can offer a 100 percent guarantee on returns, but one thing is guaranteed: You’ll need to start repaying your personal loan immediately–with interest. There are also late payment fees if you fall behind on repayment.

If you’re considering using a personal loan for an investment and require a more reliable investment option, fully investigate the different types of investments. Some, such as money market accounts, offer far reduced risk and volatility.
